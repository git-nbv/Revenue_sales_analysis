# Revenue_sales_analysis

Problem statement: 
This project is created to improve revenue/sales analysis of different shopping malls, which sells similar products

Tools used: MYSQL, POWERBI, ML-Orange, EXCEL, POWER POINT

Short Description: 

It is a query based project through SQL and obtained visuals through Power BI, similarly, insights and recommendations are explained in ppt 

Though the dataset is bigger, results are obtained from the single table, and no data model schema is not used. However, this project helped me to understand the features of Power BI very including implicit and explicit DAX functions.

The file with extension .ows could be open with the ML tool called Orange.

Further Improvements could be made on this project:

Identify better algorithm for the ML process
Though trends and patterns of hte data is clear, more information about employees, inventory, and data history would lead to more predictive/stringent solutions.
