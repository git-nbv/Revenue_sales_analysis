# Revenue_sales_analysis


This project is created based on the revenue/sales analysis of different shopping malls

Tools used: MYSQL, POWERBI, ML-Orange, EXCEL, POWER POINT

Short Description: 

It is a query based project through SQL and obtained visuals through Power BI, similarly, insights and recommendations are explained in ppt 

Though the dataset is bigger, results are obtained from the single table, and no data model schema is not used. However, this project helped me to understand the features of Power BI very including implicit and explicit DAX functions.

The file with extension .ows could be open with the ML tool called Orange.
